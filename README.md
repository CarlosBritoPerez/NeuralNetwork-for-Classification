# Neural Network for Classification

### Small project for the Intelligent Systems Foundations subject. 

This code will train a neural network by providing multiple sets of pictures and measure its accuracy using Keras API.

### Images

We provided the set of photos used.
Inside */images* you'll find two directories, *training* and *validation*. Both consist of 4 classes of pictures (hands, masks, forks and clothespins).
The program will automatically collect a number of pictures from each class in training and put them in validation.
